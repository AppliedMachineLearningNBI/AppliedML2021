# AppliedML2021 - Code Repository

GitHub repository for code used in the course "Applied Machine Learning" 2021 at University of Copenhagen.

## Getting Started

The following instructions will help you install the relevant software that will be used in the course.

You have two options for installing and running the Applied ML notebooks. The primary option is to install everything on your laptop, using e.g. the anaconda environment with a standard set of python libraries. The second option is to run the code on [ERDA](https://erda.ku.dk), a KU-based server platform that has the advantage of having a uniform software environment for everyone. If you are not enrolled as a KU student and want to use this option, you should contact [Troels](mailto:petersen@nbi.dk) to get access to the ERDA servers.

We recommend that you use your laptop, but perhaps also that you try both methods for the course. Having a local copy of the exercices can be very handy when the ERDA servers are down (for maintenance or other reasons), and when you finish your studies and start one something new. But ERDA gives you a feel for how remote computing works, and allows you to suddenly go from 1 CPU to many. Trying both is simply our attempt at boosting your knowledge of computing. But if you never try ERDA, don't worry.

### Option A. Running things on your laptop

To run things on your local computer, you will have to install additional software to be able to properly run the notebooks.

Given the wide range of operating systems available out there, we cannot guarantee that the instructions above will work on _all_ platforms. As of now, __the instructions below have been tested on the following systems:__

* [__Instructions for Linux__](./docs/install_instruction_linux.md)

* [__Instructions for Windows 10__](./docs/install_instruction_windows10.md)

* [__Instructions for MacOs Mojave__](./docs/install_instruction_macos_mojave.md)

### Option B. Running things on ERDA

* [__The instructions for using ERDA are available here__](./docs/install_instruction_erda.md)


---
### Option C. Manually downloading the course content

If you do not want to subscribe to github, you can still download manually the content of the repository using the __donwload zip__ option on the main page of this git. [More details are available here](./docs/manual_copy_of_code.md)


---
## Running things after installation

Once you have installed the required software and cloned the repository, you can run your notebooks, and update the content of the repository by following [__these instructions__](./docs/running_after_install.md)
