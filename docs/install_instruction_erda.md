## Installation instruction - ERDA

Since the software environment on ERDA already includes all the software tools necessary to run the notebooks, the only thing that has to be done there is to clone the code repository in your local workspace.


### Logging on to ERDA and cloning the code repository
---

#### Get Registered on ERDA (email [Troels](mailto:petersen@nbi.dk) to get registered)

#### [Get a github account](https://github.com/). 

If you do not wish to do so, you can still access the course content by manually downloading the repository (see __Option C__ below)

#### Clone the Applied Statistics Repository

Once you are in your __work__ folder, make yourself a local copy of the code repository by typing the command `git clone https://github.com/AppliedStatisticsNBI/AppStat2020.git ./AppStat2020_local/`. If you list the content of your __work__ directory, you should now see a local copy of the code appear on your machine.
