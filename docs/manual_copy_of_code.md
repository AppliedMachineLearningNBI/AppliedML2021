__Important note regarding a manual download:__ If you choose this method to get the course content, you will have to download a new version of the archive everytime we update an exercice or correct a mistake in the notebooks. __It is therefore highly recommended that you use github instead.__ 


__Other important Note__: You will also need to install additional software if you are running things on your laptop.
