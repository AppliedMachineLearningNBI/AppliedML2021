## Running things after installation

At this point, you have successfully installed anaconda, installed `iminuit` in your anaconda environment and cloned the applied statistics code repository somewhere on your laptop or on ERDA. Now, you want to open a notebook and start working. Follow these steps to find out how!


### Opening and running a jupyter notebook (Linux and MacOS version)

* In the __Start Menu__, open the __Anaconda Navigator__.

* Open a __Jupyter Notebook__ session.

* Use the jupyter file explorer to find the path you found earlier

* Click on the notebook to begin working


## Updating the code repository


As the week pass by, additional exercices will be periodically added to the code repository. To update your local copy of the code:

* open a terminal window

* Move to the folder where you have cloned the git: `cd /path/to/appstat/AppStat2020_local/`

* Update the content by typing: `git pull`

* __For Windows Users Only:__ To open a terminal, Use the File Explorer to locate your code folder, then right-click inside of it and select the __Git Bash Here__ option. You can then call `git pull` to update your local version of the code.
